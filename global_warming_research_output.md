1. **Causes of Global Warming**: The primary causes of global warming are emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes (1, 3).

2. **Effects of Global Warming on Climate Change**: Global warming leads to extreme weather events, sea level rise, melting ice caps, coral reef bleaching, and shifting ecosystems (2, 5).

3. **Mitigation Strategies for Global Warming**: Effective strategies to mitigate global warming include the use of renewable energy sources, carbon capture technology, improving energy efficiency, and reforestation efforts (3).

4. **International Agreements Regarding Global Warming**: The Paris Agreement is a significant international agreement aimed at addressing global warming on a global scale by setting ambitious goals to reduce GHG emissions (4).

5. **Personal Actions to Combat Global Warming**: Individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by recycling, using public transportation, and adopting energy-efficient practices at home (5).
