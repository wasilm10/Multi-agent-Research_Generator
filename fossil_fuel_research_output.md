1. **Overview of Fossil Fuels**: Fossil fuels are organic materials formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that lived millions of years ago (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel>, <https://understand-energy.stanford.edu/energy-resources/fossil-fuel-energy/introduction-fossil-fuels>).
  2. **Human Contributions to Fossil Fuels and Climate Change**: Burning fossil fuels for energy releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming (<https://www.epa.gov/burning-coal/emissions-factsheet-coal-combustion>, <https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/energy/strategy-energy-technology-innovation/content-energy-policy/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions>).
  3. **Fossil Fuels and Global Warming Impact**: Fossil fuel combustion results in carbon dioxide emissions, which are a primary driver of global warming (<https://www.energy.gov/eere/fossil/carbon-dioxide-emissions-stationary-sources>, <https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel-emission>).
  4. **Efforts to Reduce Dependence on Fossil Fuels**: Strategies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels include clean coal technologies and the development and adoption of renewable energy sources (<https://www.energy.gov/eere/fossil/clean-coal>, <https://www.epa.gov/energy/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency-strategies-mitigate-climate-change>).
  5. **Global Cooperation and Policy on Fossil Fuels and Climate Change**: The Paris Agreement is an international accord aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on fossil fuels (<https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement>, <https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/international-actions>).
