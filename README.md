# Multi-agent-Research_Generator
A modular, autonomous research assistant built using CrewAI, Ollama (Mistral), LangChain, SerpAPI, and the arXiv API. This system uses multiple LLM-powered agents to automate academic topic breakdown, web/academic semantic search, summarization, and source evaluation. Outputs are generated in Markdown and optionally PDF format
