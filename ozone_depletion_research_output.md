1. **Definition and Mechanisms of Ozone Depletion**: Ozone depletion refers to a decrease in Earth's stratospheric ozone layer. It is primarily caused by the breakdown of ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), released into the atmosphere through human activities (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion>, <https://www.epa.gov/stratospheric-ozone>).
  2. **Effects of Ozone Depletion**: The depletion of the ozone layer allows more ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach Earth's surface, which can have harmful effects on ecosystems and human health (<https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/ozone-depletion-14762859>).
  3. **International Response to Ozone Depletion**: The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement aimed at reducing the production of ozone-depleting substances (<https://www.epa.gov/stratospheric-ozone>, <https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/ozone-day>).
  4. **Current State and Future Challenges**: The global community has made progress in reducing emissions of ozone-depleting substances, but ongoing efforts are needed to monitor and protect the ozone layer (<https://www3.unep.org/ozone/en/science-policy>).
  5. **Scientific Insights**: The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the breakdown of ozone-depleting substances in the presence of UV radiation, a process known as photolysis (<https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/ozone-depletion-14762859>).
