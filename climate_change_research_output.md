* **Causes of Global Warming**: The primary causes of global warming are greenhouse gas emissions, particularly Carbon Dioxide and Methane, as well as deforestation and industrial activities, such as fossil fuel combustion ([1](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), [2](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)).
* **Effects of Global Warming**: Some of the adverse impacts of global warming include rising sea levels, melting polar ice caps, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts), and disruptions in ecosystems and biodiversity ([1](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), [2](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)).
* **Mitigation Strategies**: Measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing down global warming include the use of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies, reforestation, and sustainable agriculture practices ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change#Mitigation)).
* **Global Climate Change Policy & Legislation**: The Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol, and various national climate change acts and regulations are examples of international agreements, policies, and laws designed to combat global warming ([4](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/policyandmeasures)).
* **Case Studies of Impacted Regions**: The Arctic, Greenland, Maldives, Pacific Islands, and Amazon Rainforest are examples of regions severely affected by global warming, showcasing the local implications and challenges in dealing with climate change ([5](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/environment/global-warming/arctic/), [6](https://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180710-the-island-nation-fighting-to-survive)).
